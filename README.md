Project Overview

The goal will be to build a model that can predict the main programming language of a repository, given the text of the README file.

### Objectives

    Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter notebook final report.

    Create modules (wrangle.py) that make our process repeateable and our report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

### Deliverables

    - A GitHub repository containing our work
    - a well-documented jupyter notebook that contains our analysis
    - a README file that contains a description of our project, as well as instructions on how to run it
    2-5 google slides suitable for a general audience
        our slides should summarize our findings in exploration and the results of our modeling
        include well-labeled visualizations in our slides
        our google slide deck should be linked in the README of our repository

### Project Planning
Outline:

    Acquire & Prepare Data
    Exploration
    Modeling
    Conclusion

### 1. Acquire & Prepare
Acquire Actions

    Data acquired from web-scraping 5 pages of README.md files from popular github repositories on 15 May 2023.
    Filters: Java, Javascript, Python, most starred

Prepare Actions:

   
Functions called from wrangle.py:

    

### 2. Exploration/ Correlation Analysis

Here are the steps I took during the exploration phase:
